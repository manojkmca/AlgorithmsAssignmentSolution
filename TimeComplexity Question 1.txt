Find the time complexity of the below functions in Θ form. 
Write NA if the function does not apply to any case.

a) T (n) = 3T (n/2) + n  in Θ form 
=> T (n) = Θ(nlg 3)

b) T (n) = 64T (n/8) − n^2(log n)  in Θ form
=> Does not apply (f(n) is not positive)

c) T (n) = 2nT (n/2) + n^n  in Θ form 
=> Does not apply (a is not constant)

d) T (n) = 3T (n/3) + n/2  in Θ form

e) T (n) = 7T (n/3) + n^2  in Θ form 
=> T (n) = Θ(n2)
